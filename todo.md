- create a image uploader instead of url addition
- create a bulk user api from excel/or normal json data
- see a formik library for creating forms dynamically from json
- add error handling via zod or validator 
- to do add a common package for test payloads
- call feed api when lenght of users is decreasing
- add custom hooks for calling api so each component is just doing its work instead of calling data as well
